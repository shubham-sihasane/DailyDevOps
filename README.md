# 🚀 DailyDevOps  
_The unstoppable journey of Cloud & DevOps mastery_  

Welcome to **DailyDevOps** — my personal logbook where I document daily learnings, experiments, and reflections on **Cloud, DevOps, and modern world practices**.  

This repository is not just a notebook — it’s a **living knowledge base** that grows one commit at a time. Think of it as a **DevOps diary meets open-source playbook**.

## 🌱 About This Repository
Every day, I dedicate time to learning something new in **Cloud** and **DevOps** — whether it’s AI, Git, GitHub, Linux, Cloud, Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, GitOps or CI/CD pipelines.  

This repo is my **public commitment** to:
- Stay consistent with daily learning  
- Share knowledge openly with the community  
- Build a resource that others can learn from  

## 🧭 Learning Philosophy
- **Consistency over intensity** → Small, daily progress compounds into mastery.  
- **Hands-on first** → Theory is important, but practice makes it stick.  
- **Document everything** → If it’s not written down, it’s forgotten.  
- **Community-driven** → Sharing knowledge helps everyone grow.
